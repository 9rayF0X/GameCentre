# GAME CENTER
In this project, we implemented three games, Sliding Tile, 2048 and Calculator,
by introducing User along with scoreboard and adding difficulty of the game.
We linked users' performance of playing the game by user names
such that each user's scores are all recorded and can be displayed individually on scoreboard.

## GETTING STARTED
In order to set up the Game Center, you can git clone https://markus.teach.cs.toronto.edu/git/csc207-2018-09-reg/group_0677
by using git to download a working copy of the game.
In order to run the game, emulators in Android Studio or android phones should be used.
We suggest users run the game on **Pixel 2**, or an emulator of this model.
Install a Pixel 2 emulator, specifying the device OS as Android 8.1 API 27 and leave all other settings to default values.
Other emulators with **API27** and **Android 8.1** may also be used.

**Additionally, the code only runs on Java 1.8 and above since we implemented new applications that are limited to 1.8 and above**
